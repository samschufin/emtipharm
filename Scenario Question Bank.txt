Aspirin
Difficulty	Scenario	Correct Answer	Explanation
Easy	54-y o male, crushing chest pain, BP 138/84, no bleeding/allergy. What do you administer en route?	Chew 324 mg (4 × 81 mg) aspirin.	Early ASA decreases mortality in acute coronary syndrome when no contraindication exists. 
Strems Council
Medium	Same patient took 325 mg ASA 20 min ago at home. Next step?	Do not repeat aspirin; document prior dose.	A single 160–325 mg pre-hospital dose suffices; extra dosing ↑ bleeding risk without added benefit. 
Strems Council
Hard	68-y o on warfarin, tarry stool yesterday, suspected MI. Administer ASA?	Withhold and consult OLMC.	Active/possible GI bleed on anticoagulation is a protocol contraindication.
